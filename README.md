# BroadcastMessagingSystem
 The use of C to provide a backend service to broadcast telnet messages from any connected actor (person or machine) to all other connected actors

This academic project aims at creating a backend chat service, where clients (people, machines) can connect to via TelNet communication protocol. This project allows several computers to communicate between them: it launches a server in one IP address, and then you can connect to this server through TELNET protocol.
